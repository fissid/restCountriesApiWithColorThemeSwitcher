This is a web page that I used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, JavaScript and RestAPI to create it.</br> </hr>
You can read and learn any country's information on the earth such as native name, population, languages, capital, timezone, calling code, borders with other countries, google map link, etc. </br>
You can find any country by a live search engine on top of the page, you don't need to write the complete name of the country and it will suggest and show you the results that are related to your inputs. </br>
You can sort the countries by continent by using the dropdown button at the top of the page. </br>
You can change the theme of the page by using the light or dark mode button on top of the page. </br>
Have fun and browse it, and if you have any feedback or suggestions, I will be happy to be in touch. </br>
